        <h2>Financial Products and Services Overview</h2>
        <p>This page provides general, high-level information on the common products offered by major US banks and credit unions like Navy Federal, SchoolsFirst, Citibank, and Bank of America. For specific terms, eligibility, and rates, please consult the official institution websites.</p>

        <h3>1. Deposit Accounts</h3>
        <p>These are the foundational accounts for managing daily and long-term funds.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Checking Accounts:</strong> Used for everyday transactions, bill pay, and withdrawals. Features often include mobile check deposit, debit cards, and online bill pay services. Institutions may offer different tiers of checking accounts (e.g., standard, student, interest-bearing).</li>
            <li><strong>Savings Accounts:</strong> Accounts designed for long-term growth and stability. These typically offer higher interest rates (APY) than checking accounts but may have limits on monthly withdrawals.</li>
            <li><strong>Certificates of Deposit (CDs):</strong> Time-deposit accounts where money is locked away for a fixed term (e.g., 6 months, 5 years) in exchange for a guaranteed interest rate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Lending and Credit</h3>
        <p>Financial institutions are the primary source for borrowing funds for large purchases.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mortgages:</strong> Loans used to purchase real estate. Options include fixed-rate, adjustable-rate, and specific first-time buyer programs.</li>
            <li><strong>Auto Loans:</strong> Financing for purchasing a vehicle, either new or used. Rates depend heavily on the borrower's credit score and the loan term.</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Loans:</strong> Unsecured loans that can be used for various purposes, such as consolidating debt or funding a large expense. Interest rates are typically higher than secured loans.</li>
            <li><strong>Credit Cards:</strong> Revolving credit lines that allow users to make purchases and pay the balance over time. Cards vary widely based on rewards, APR, annual fees, and introductory offers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Digital and Technology Services</h3>
        <p>Modern banking relies heavily on technology for security and convenience.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Online Banking & Mobile Apps:</strong> Platforms for accessing accounts, reviewing transactions, transferring funds, and paying bills remotely.</li>
            <li><strong>ATM Networks:</strong> Accessibility to physical cash. Major banks often belong to large networks (e.g., MoneyPass), while credit unions sometimes use shared branching networks.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Measures:</strong> All reputable institutions offer robust security, including two-factor authentication, fraud monitoring, and encrypted communications.</li>
        </ul>
